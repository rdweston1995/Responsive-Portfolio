      <p>My name is Robert Weston and I live in the Kent area of Washington State. I currently work for the Renton Parks 
        department at Coulon park. Outside of work and school for fun I spend time outdoors hiking, biking, and photography. I'm planning on 
        climbing all the major peaks in the pacific north west starting with the ones in Washington State. Starting with Mt. St Helens 
        in this upcoming fall and then moving on to Glacier Peak, Mt. Baker, and then Mt. Rainier. I've studied at Green River College and most recently 
        Bellevue College. At both instituions I studied Computer Science with a primary focus on Java and Python languages. My main goal with my career is 
        to work for SpaceX to help push the bounds of human space travel. I'd also like to start my own business one day in the cyber security sector.
