                <p>My name is Robert Weston and I live in the Kent area of Washington State. I currently work for the Renton Parks 
                    department at Coulon park. Outside of work and school for fun I spend time outdoors hiking, biking, and photography. I'm planning on 
                    climbing all the major peaks in the pacific north west starting with the ones in Washington State. Starting with Mt. St Helens 
                    in this upcoming fall and then moving on to Glacier Peak, Mt. Baker, and then Mt. Rainier. I've studied at Green River College and most recently 
                    Bellevue College. At both instituions I studied Computer Science with a primary focus on Java and Python languages. My main goal with my career is 
                    to work for SpaceX to help push the bounds of human space travel. I'd also like to start my own business one day in the cyber security sector.
